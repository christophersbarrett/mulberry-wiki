* Template yml format changes:
    * regions no longer use `containerType` property
    * regions now have a `type` property which can have the value of `row`, `column`, or `component`
* Added `toura.app.Phonegap.registerAPI` method in #119
* Changed format of generators - instead of `create_template`, `create_page`, it's now `create template`, `create page`, etc. (ref: https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/130)
* Upgraded Evergreen test helper to 1.0.0
* Upgraded jshintrb to be more flexible about which version of therubyracer it uses
