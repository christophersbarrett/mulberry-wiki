## Features & Improvements
* Added `toura.app.Phonegap.registerAPI` method
* It's no longer necessary to override the default styles. When an app is scaffolded, the default theme is copied into the app, but it's not required to use it. It can be edited and modified. To pull any upstream changes to the built-in themes, a `mulberry update_themes` command was added.
* `mulberry create component` now creates a placeholder .scss file and adds an `@import` statement.
* `mulberry scaffold <appname>` now creates a file at `javascript/base.js`, which eliminates a 404 error
* `mulberry scaffold` when run from inside a Mulberry project will now create any pages that are specified in the sitemap but that do not exist.
* The built-in ImageGallery component now has dots to indicate its status.
* Kitchensink demo now includes NodeGallery page.
* Introduced `populate` and `populateElement` instance methods on components.
* Added `mulberry.route` and `mulberry.routes` for defining custom routes.
* Added support for pages to have "featured" images, which are used when displaying a page as an image (for example, in a grid view of child pages)
* A new `published` property in an app's `config.yml` will be used as the version for app stores.

## Changes
* Template yml format changes:
    * regions no longer use `containerType` property
    * regions now have a `type` property which can have the value of `row`, `column`, or `component`
* Changed format of generators - instead of `create_template`, `create_page`, it's now `create template`, `create page`, etc. (ref: https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/130)
* Videos page template converted to configurable system.
* Initial work on web builds.
* weinre now uses api.toura.com
* Upgraded Evergreen test helper to 1.0.0
* Upgraded jshintrb to be more flexible about which version of therubyracer it uses
