This is a bugfix and refactoring release. It should include no breaking changes for "public" APIs.

- Added tests for the TouraAPP class.
- Added a version command to the Mulberry CLI: `mulberry version` or `mulberry -v`.
- Build helpers now return an object, not a string, when asked for application data.
- Added Capybara and some incredibly basic integration tests.
- Converted the GoogleMaps1 page template to the new "configurable" template definition style.
- Fixed some issues in the audios-with-text-* page templates.
- Updated the license on the built JavaScript to reflect the Mulberry licensing terms.
- Fixed the iPhone project template to disable ARC.
- Fixed an issue where `mulberry test` failed on projects without a `javascript` directory.
- Fixed an issue with Android builds that only affected Eclipse.
- Capabilities will now throw an error if their requirements aren't met.
- Fixed an issue where custom JS wasn't being properly built.
- Fixed an issue where ChildBrowser wasn't declared as a property of `window` on iOS, which was preventing Facebook posting.
- Fixed Facebook, Twitter API keys to be camelCased, not underscore.
