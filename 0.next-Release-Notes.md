## Changes
* Removed `builder/project_templates/android/local.properties` file. From the Mulberry root directory, you must run the following command after pulling as your local file will be removed:
`android update project -p builder/project_templates/android/`
([issue: 319](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/319))
* Updated rvm to 1.9.3. If you use rvm, you must run:
 
 1. `rvm install 1.9.3`
 1. `rvm use 1.9.3`
 1. `rvm gemset create mulberry`
 1. `rvm use 1.9.3@mulberry`
 1. `bundle install`

Also, if you added an .rvmrc into your scaffolded application directories to help work around this issue, be sure to delete it. Otherwise you will receive (harmless, but disconcerting) "RVM is not a function" warnings. 

**OPTIONAL:**
Note that the lack of a .rvmrc in the 'mulberry' installation directory will make it impossible for you to run the tests. To fix this, you'll need to re-create a .rvmrc file in your mulberry root directory and add:

`rvm use 1.9.3@mulberry` 

as the file contents. Note this will re-introduce the spurious "RVM is not a function" warnings if you are running mulberry commands **within the mulberry repository** (will not produce warnings in your app projects).

([issue: 357](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/357))

* This release introduced a separate `toura.base` file; you'll need to add `dojo.require('toura.base');` to your apps' `javascript/base.js` files in order to get access to Toura-specific functionality.

([issue: 354](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/354)) The organization of scss files has changed drastically. The `javascript` directory has been renamed `app` to include scss files as well. Themes are no longer defined in the `config.yml` file. There is no `themes` directory. All styles are should be imported from `app/base.scss`. To upgrade your app, rename the 'javascript' directory to 'app'. Existing apps that used the 'default' theme can get those styles by following these steps:

* Scaffold another app. We're going to copy some files it creates into the your application. 
* Copy these files and directories from the scaffolded /app directory to your /app directory:
    * _toura.scss
    * base.scss
    * resources/
    * styles/
