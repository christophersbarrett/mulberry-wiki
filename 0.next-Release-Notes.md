## Changes
* Removed `builder/project_templates/android/local.properties` file. From the Mulberry root directory, you must run the following command after pulling as your local file will be removed:
`android update project -p builder/project_templates/android/`
([issue: 319](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/319))
* Updated rvm to 1.9.3. If you use rvm, you must run:
 
 1. `rvm install 1.9.3`
 1. `rvm use 1.9.3`
 1. `rvm gemset create mulberry`
 1. `rvm use 1.9.3@mulberry`
 1. `bundle install`

Also, if you added an .rvmrc into your scaffolded application directories to help work around this issue, be sure to delete it. Otherwise you will receive (harmless, but disconcerting) "RVM is not a function" warnings. 

Note that the lack of a .rvmrc in the 'mulberry' installation directory will make it impossible for you to run the tests (or any other ruby command that is not `mulberry`). To fix this, you'll need to re-create a .rvmrc file in your mulberry root directory and add:

`rvm use 1.9.3@mulberry` 

as the file contents.

* This release introduced a separate `toura.base` file; you'll need to add `dojo.require('toura.base');` to your apps' `javascript/base.js` files in order to get access to Toura-specific functionality.
