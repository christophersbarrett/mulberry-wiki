## Changes
* Removed `builder/project_templates/android/local.properties` file. From the Mulberry root directory, you must run the following command after pulling as your local file will be removed:
`android update project -p builder/project_templates/android/`
([issue: 319](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/319))
* Added `rvm.rc` to base project. If you use rvm, you must run:
 
 1. `rvm install 1.9.3`
 1. `rvm use 1.9.3`
 1. `rvm gemset create mulberry`
 1. `rvm use 1.9.3@mulberry`
 1. `bundle install`

* Created a separate `toura.base` file; you'll need to add `dojo.require('toura.base');` to your `javascript/base.js` file in order to get access to Toura-specific functionality.
