* Theming changes: To get the changes, run `mulberry update_themes` and resolve any conflicts manually 
  * Icons have been moved to `themes/default/resources/icons`. 
  * All colors have been extracted to `themes/default/_settings.scss`
  * Instead of defining layout in page_def yaml files, use mixins in page_def scss files
    * Any references to the following sass mixins should be changed:
      * `column-container` -> `flex-column-container`
      * `row-container` -> `flex-row-container`
    * For any custom templates you've created:
      * create an scss file in `themes/<my theme>/pagedefs`
      * remove all `type:<row, column>` parameters from the yaml. Apply `flex-row-container` and `flex-column-container` to their parent region in scss instead
      * remove all `layout: size-fixed` from the yaml. Apply `fixed-flex-region` to the element in the scss instead
  * _ImageScroller and VideoPlayer markup and css changed
