# Components

Pages in Mulberry are displayed using a combination of components as specified by
the page's template. Each component receives information about the page that is
being displayed, as well as information about where on the page the component
will be displayed.

Components are responsible for receiving data to be displayed; displaying the
data using a template; and observing and announcing user interaction. All
built-in and custom components follow the same basic path:

- Receive information about the page and store that information in the
  component instance's `baseObj` property.
- Use the `baseObj` and other data to prepare the data to be used by the
  component's template.
- Create a DOM structure by populating the template with the prepared data.
- Register event listeners that call methods of the component when the event
  occurs.
- Expose an API for updating the component's data, if required.

## Built-In Components

Mulberry comes with several built-in components that you can use in your own
templates; they are located at `toura_app/javascript/toura/components/`. The
built-in components are described below, including the asset type(s) that the
component works with. *Asset types* appear in italics. For more about the
different asset types, see the Assets documentation.

### AppNav

Displays application-level navigation elements, including links to the built-in
Search, About, and Favorites pages.

### AssetList

Displays a list of assets, and announces when a user selects an asset from the
list.

### AudioCaption

Displays a caption for an audio. Exposes a setter that allows changing the
content of the caption. (Based on BodyText.)

### AudioList

An audio-specific AssetList.

### AudioPlayer

A wrapper around an HTML5 audio player -- with fallbacks for browsers that do
not support the HTML5 `audio` tag -- for displaying an *audio*. Exposes a
setter that allows changing the current audio source file. Announces user
interaction with the player.

### BodyText

Displays the *body text* associated with a page, and exposes a setter that
allows the content to be updated.

### ChildNodeGrid

Displays the *subpages* of the page in a grid layout; each item in the grid
links to the corresponding page. (Subpages must have a `featured_image`
property specified in order to be displayed in the grid.)

### ChildNodes

Displays the *subpages* of the page in a list layout; each item in the list
links to the corresponding page.

### ColumnHeaderImage

Displays the page's *header* image inside a column region (see the Page Templates
documentation for more information on templates and regions).

### DetailTitle

Displays a title region on a detail screen (see the Page Templates
documentation for more information on templates and screens), and exposes a
setter for setting the title. Announces user interaction with the close button.

### FeedItemDetail

Displays the contents of an RSS *feed* item, including an image enclosure if one
is included in the feed item.

### FeedItemList

Displays a list of RSS items from a *feed*. Announces a user's selection from
the list of items.

### GoogleMap

Displays a set of *locations* on a Google Map, and displays information about each
location when the user selects a location.

### ImageCaption

Displays a caption for an image. Exposes a setter that allows changing the
content of the caption. (Based on BodyText.)

### ImageDetail

Displays a set of *images* in a full-screen gallery; each image can be panned and zoomed.
Announces user interaction with the gallery.

### ImageGallery

Displays a set of *images* in a swipeable gallery. Announces user interaction
with the gallery.

### LocationList

Displays a set of *locations*.

### NodeTitleBanner

Displays the page title.

### PageHeaderImage

Displays the page's *header* image across the width of the page.

### PageNav

Displays the page's title, as well as various page and application tools.

### VideoCaption

Displays a caption for a video. Exposes a setter that allows changing the
content of the caption. (Based on BodyText.)

### VideoPlayer

A wrapper around an HTML5 video player -- with fallbacks for browsers that do
not support the HTML5 `video` tag -- for displaying a *video*. Exposes a
setter that allows changing the current video source file. Announces user
interaction with the player.


## Creating Your Own Components

Mulberry exposes a simple API for creating custom components that you can use on
your own page templates. This section explains how you might create a simple
component for displaying a Twitter feed.

To start, run the following command from your app directory:

    mulberry create_component Twitter

This will:

- create a stub component file at `javascript/components/Twitter.js`
- create a component resources directory at `javascript/components/Twitter/`
- create a component template file at
  `javascript/components/Twitter/Twitter.haml`
- add the appropriate `dojo.require` statement to your project's base
  JavaScript file, located at `javascript/base.js`

To start with, edit the component's template file. This file uses
[Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) to generate markup from JavaScript. Your Twitter
component can have a simple template:

    %ul.component.twitter

Once you save this file, the component is usable in a page template, but it
won't do much -- it will put the empty unordered list in the page, but nothing
more.  Next, we need to tell the component how to behave by editing the file at
`javascript/components/Twitter.js`.

The component will need to know the username for which it should fetch tweets;
in order for this component to be reusable, we don't want to hard-code that
information into the component. Instead, we can use data that we attached to
the page:

    dojo.provide('client.components.Twitter');

    (function() {
      var userTweets = function(settings) {
            return toura.tmpl(
              'http://twitter.com/status/user_timeline/' +
              '${username}.json?count=${count}',
              settings
            );
          };

      toura.customComponent('Twitter', {
        componentTemplate : dojo.cache('client.components', 'Twitter/Twitter.haml'),

        init : function() {
          var data = this.node.data[0].json;

          $.ajax(userTweets(data), {
            dataType : 'jsonp',
            success : $.proxy(this, '_onLoad')
          });
        },

        _onLoad : function(tweets) {

        }
      });

    }());

(See the Assets documentation for information on attaching data to a page.)

In the above code, we've added a "private" function, `userTweets`, that takes a
settings object. The `toura.tmpl` method uses the settings object's `username`
and `count` properties to create and return a URL for fetching JSONP data from
Twitter. We use jQuery's `$.ajax` method to load the data, and specify that we
should call the component's `_onLoad` method when the data is returned.

Next, we need to fill out the `_onLoad` method so it will populate our
component with the data:

    dojo.provide('client.components.Twitter');

    (function() {
      var userTweets = function(settings) {
            return toura.tmpl(
              'http://twitter.com/status/user_timeline/' +
              '${username}.json?count=${count}',
              settings
            );
          },

          tweetURL = function(settings) {
            return toura.tmpl(
              'http://twitter.com/capitoljs/status/${id_str}',
              settings
            );
          };

      toura.customComponent('Twitter', {
        componentTemplate : dojo.cache('client.components', 'Twitter/Twitter.haml'),

        tweetTemplate : dojo.cache('client.components', 'Twitter/Tweet.haml'),

        init : function() {
          var data = this.node.data[0].json;

          $.ajax(userTweets(data), {
            dataType : 'jsonp',
            success : $.proxy(this, '_onLoad')
          });
        },

        _onLoad : function(tweets) {
          // prep the template
          var tpl = toura.haml(this.tweetTemplate),

              html = $.map(tweets, function(tweet) {
                // prepare the tweet data
                tweet.link = tweetURL(tweet);
                tweet.text = tweet.text.replace(
                  /@(\S+)/,
                  "<a href='http://twitter.com/#!/$1'>@$1</a>"
                );

                // populate the tweet template
                return tpl(tweet);
              }).join('');

          // place the tweets markup in the component
          this.$domNode.html(html);

          // tell the containing region
          // to update its scroller, if required
          this.region.refreshScroller();
        }
      });

    }());

Here, we've done a few things:

- we added another "private" helper function, `tweetURL`
- we added another template, `tweetTemplate`
- we used `toura.haml` to turn the `tweetTemplate` string into a working Haml
  template function, which we then call with the data for each tweet
- we used jQuery to place the markup for all the tweets in the component's root
  DOM node
- we asked the region that contains the component to refresh its scroller,
  because the size of the component has changed since it was rendered

We now have a working Twitter component that we can use in our custom page
templates. To use this component in a page template definition, be sure to
prefix it with `custom:`. So:

    custom:Twitter

### Querying the DOM of Your Component

If your component code needs to refer to a specific element in your component's
DOM structure, you can query that element using jQuery or dojo.query, but a
better solution is to label the element as a `dojoAttachPoint` in the component template.

    %div.component.twitter
      %button{ dojoAttachPoint : 'refreshButton' }
      %ul{ dojoAttachPoint : 'tweetsList' }

These nodes will automatically be available to you as `this.refreshButton` and
`this.tweetsList` in your component code.

### Component Properties

All component instances have a slew of built-in properties that you can take
advantage of.

#### baseObj

An object representing the page on which the component is being displayed. This
object contains all of the asset data associated with the page.

#### device

A object containing information about the device environment, with a `type` and
`os` property.

#### domNode

The root DOM node.

#### $domNode

A jQuery object containing the component's root DOM node.

#### region

The region in which the component is displayed.

#### screen

The screen on which the component is displayed.

### Component Properties You Can Provide

#### componentTemplate

A string that can be parsed as Haml that will be used to construct the
component. This can be a plain string, or a string returned by `dojo.cache`
(see the example above). If you do not provide a `componentTemplate` property,
then the default is `%div`.

### Component Lifecycle Methods

Components call many methods during their setup -- see
`toura_app/javascript/toura/components/_Component.js` for details -- but there
are a couple that you need to know about when creating your own components. You
can specify what should happen during these steps by defining a method
for that step in the object you pass to `mulberry.component`.

- `prep`: Prepare the data that your component will need. In this method, you
  can rearrange data that's contained in the component's `baseObj` property,
  which will contain all of the information that Mulberry knows about the page
  that's using the component.
- `init`: Once the component has been placed on the page, you can do any setup
  that's required in this method.

### Connecting to Events

While Mulberry provides access to jQuery API methods for convenience, _you should not
use jQuery for connecting to events unless you have a plan for managing the
teardown of those events_ when moving to a new page. Instead, you should use the
component's built-in `connect` method, which will automatically manage event
teardown.

    this.connect(this.refreshButton, 'click', '_onRefresh');

The above code registers an event listener on the DOM node referenced by
`this.refreshButton`. When the node is clicked, the component's `_onRefresh`
method will be called. Note that you must define the `_onRefresh` method.

### Providing Setter Methods

If you want other parts of your application to be able to change the data for
your component, you need to define setter methods on your component. For
example, if you wanted to allow other pieces of your app to change the username
that the Twitter component is using, you could provide a method
`_setUsernameAttr` in your component definition:

    _setUsernameAttr : function(username) {
      $.ajax(userTweets({ username : username, count : 20 }), {
        dataType : 'jsonp',
        success : $.proxy(this, '_onLoad')
      })
    }

Then, any piece of your application that has a reference to an instance of the
Twitter component can set the username for that instance:

    myTwitterInstance.set('username', 'rmurphey');

### Announcing Interaction

When a user interacts with a component, you may want to announce that
interaction so other pieces of the application can react.

For announcements that are of interest to other components on a page, you
should use custom event methods. For example, if you wanted to announce when a
user clicked on the Twitter refresh button, you could do the following in your
component's `init` method:

    this.connect(this.refreshButton, 'click', '_onRefresh');

Then, you would define `_onRefresh` and `onRefresh` methods for your component:

    // ...

    _onRefresh : function() {
      // ... code to refresh the component ...
      this.refreshTimes = (this.refreshTimes || 0)++;
      this.onRefresh(this.refreshTimes);
    },

    onRefresh : function(refreshTimes) {
      // stub for connection
    },

    // ...

Now, you can define a capability that listens to the component's `onRefresh`
custom event method. For details, see the docs for Capabilities.

For announcements that are interesting beyond the page you're currently on --
for instance, announcements that may alter the overall application behavior --
you can publish your announcement:

    _onRefresh : function() {
      // ... code to refresh the component ...
      this.refreshTimes = (this.refreshTimes || 0)++;
      toura.publish('/twitter/refresh', [ this.refreshTimes ]);
    }

Then, other pieces of your application can subscribe to these announcements:

    toura.subscribe('/twitter/refresh', function(refreshTimes) {
      // ...
    });
