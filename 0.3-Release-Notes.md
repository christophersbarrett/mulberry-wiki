## Features & Improvements
* Upgraded to PhoneGap 1.3

* Added the ability to create custom properties on pages. If you create a field in the yaml frontmatter of your page, it will available in your component. ([issue: 148](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/148))

* Created a theme `resources` directory for images, fonts, etc. Place any files your theme needs in `themes/<my theme>/resources`, then refer to them in `resources` (no slashes) in your scss, and it'll work on the server and in the build. ([issue: 155](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/155))

* Added `mulberry create route` command. For example, run `mulberry create route '/foo/:bar'` and it will generate the necessary code and add it to `routes.js`, which you can then customize. ([issue: 158]

* Improved the design of the grid view page_def for tablet. ([issue: 177](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/177))

* Added the ability to run `mulberry` commands from any directory inside a Mulberry project, whereas previously it only worked at the project route. ([issue: 178](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/178))

* Parameterized the "default" theme colors and fonts. Change the values in `themes/default/_settings.scss` and they'll be used globally. ([issue: 182](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/182))

* Improved the design of the image gallery, audio, and video page_defs. ([issue: 183](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/183))

* Created installer scripts for OSX and Windows. Find the installation instructions for your OS in [`/install/<os>/`](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/tree/master/install), follow the instructions in the README, then run the installer script.
([issue: 220](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/220))

* Added `mulberry.createPage` as a shorthand method for `toura.app.PageFactory.createPage`

* Added `mulberry.showPage` as a shorthand method for `toura.app.UI.showPage`

* Added `mulberry.store` and `mulberry.model` for creating data persistence stores and models. See `app/toura/_Store.js` and `app/toura/_Model.js`.

## Changes

([issue: 172](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/172))

* Added a wrapper for PhoneGap device APIs: geolocation, accelerometer, camera API.
([issue: 193](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/193))

* Cleaned up locations of JS build directories.
([issue: 197](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/197))

* Renamed `toura.pageControllers.Configurable` to `toura.Page`.
([issue: 202](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/202))

([issue: 205](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/205))

([issue: 222](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/222))

* Renamed `toura.Page` to `toura.containers.Page`
([issue: 222](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/222))

* Renamed `toura.containers.Pages` to `toura.containers.Viewport`
([issue: 222](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/222))

* Anonymous reporting of CLI usage. When you scaffold an app, you'll be prompted whether you want to send anonymous data to us which we'll use to help improve Mulberry. ([issue: 232](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/232), [issue: 247](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/247))

* Removed style (`type: row|column`, `size: fixed`) attributes from pagedefs and replaced that functionality with Sass mixins. To create rows, use `flex-row-container`; to create columns, use `flex-column-container`; to create make a region within a flex container to be fixed-size, use `fixed-flex-region` ([issue: 233](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/233)). 

* Added a simpler JSONP helper. This avoids the need to use `dojo.io.script.get`. Instead, you can do: `toura.jsonp(url, config))`;
([issue: 239](https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/pull/239))
